My Plan- Sparkles the Unicorn    

     
 Interface sample I am going for:
	Sparkles the Unicorn
	Hunger: 30
	Thirst: 30
	Boredom: 30
	Tiredness: 30
	
	- I want to start off with levels of 30 each with a max of 50 and can go down to 0. Increments and decrements go by 10's.
	- User wants to keep levels high rather than keeping it low.  
	- This game will probably end fast for the user. 
	
	This is the menu options
	
	What do you want to do?
	1. Feed Sparkles a cupcake
	2. Give Sparkles champagne
	3. Play Beyonce songs for Sparkles to dance to
	4. Tuck Sparkles in to bed
	5. Do nothing

	You fed Sparkles a cupcake.
	
	I have tick method called for each time the menu come up.
	The tick is to show time has passed and it takes 5 points away each time.
